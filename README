# Legends tell of a Dude, a legendary Dude born once every thousand years who has the strength to fight some slimes and stuff.

# You have been born into a crappy town living in an equally crappy house near a crappy dungeon.

# One day you decide to go in or something only to find out that you.. in fact... are the Dungeon Dude!

# Welcome to Dungeon Dude, the game where you explore an ever increasingly difficult dungeon and fight a variety of poorly coded monsters!

# After creating and logging in with your account, you can see you have a few options.

# You can save and heal in your home, or head out into the city.

# In the city you can interact with npcs to buy goods, or take on quests to complete in the dungeon.

# In the dungeon, starting from the beginning the monsters are weak and easy. But as you go deeper they gain strength.

# Every 5 floors in the dungeon, the player encounters a boss! Bosses have a better chance of dropping rarer items!

# The player gains exp by either killing monsters/bosses, or completing quests from npcs.

# Each user account can have multiple characters, and switch out whenever they want.

# Can you be the Dungeon Dude who defeats the legendary boss on the 100th floor???

-From a technical perspective on this project. This uses a Flask SQLalchemy backend, and a React front end.
-There a about a dozen tables and multiple many to many relationships being handled in models.py
-In the app.py I have created routes to handle different actions taken by the user such as creating or deleting an account... and lots else
-Passwords are hashed through Bcrypt to create security for the users accounts.
